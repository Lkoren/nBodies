			<p>This is an experimental, n-body simulator, running in WebGL. This would not have been possible without Mr Doob's excellent <a href = " ">three.js</a> framework, as well as the excellent <a href="http://www.artcompsci.org/">Art of Computational Science/Maya Open Lab</a> resource by Piet Hut and Jun Makino. While incomplete and, apparently inactive, the Maya Open Lab is an excellent introduction to Ruby, astronomical simulation and the nuances of numerical simulation.</p>

			<p>The N Body problem dates to Netwon's work on gravity. Two bodies moving under the influence of gravity have a small and well-understood set of behaviors -- they orbit each other. However, three or more bodies behave in much more complex ways. General analytic solutions to the three body problem have been discovered over the decades (several of them by major figures of 18/19th century math), as well as most recently by [insert names].</p>

			<p>Currently this simulation models bodies as point masses, and uses a leap-frog integration method to calculate motion. Leap-frog is time-reversible, but only second-order accurate. Numerical easing hasn't yet been implimented (but is on the dev path), which can result in bad solutions when two particles interact closely. A implimenting a runga-kutta [sp?] fourth-order integrator is also part of the dev-path. Currently I am still focused on developing several core interface features.</p>
